# DasOS

## Goal

Simple, single task, single thread OS with a focus on graphics and gaming with support of networking,
graphics and sound. All programs will run in fullscreen with a small OS status bar at the bottom.

## Planned Features

- FAT32 Driver (*pending*)
- Keyboard Input
- Sound Driver (*pending*)
- Network (IP)
	- TCP (*pending*)
	- UDP (*pending*)
- Graphical Interface
	- VBE (*pending*)
	- TinyGL (*pending*)
- Graphical Shell
	- Start program (*pending*)
	- Options (*pending*)
	- Shutdown (*pending*)

## Architecture

### Memory Layout
Everything in the first gigabyte of virtual memory is designated for the kernel,
everything above is available for the user programs.

### User Programs
User Programs will have their entry point at 0x40000000, all memory above is available for the user.

### Kernel API
The kernel will export all required functions via simple calls, no syscall interface required.
